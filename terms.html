            <h2>Privacy Notice</h2>
            <p>In this Notice, we, The Temple Inn & Suites and its entities, provide you with information about how we
                process your personal data. </p>
            <h3>1. Who controls your personal data?</h3>

            <p>We may process and make publicly available personal data obtained from published sources. We may process
                and publish living information in compliance with applicable local laws.</p>

            <p>Your location-based information may be collected by some mobile applications for the purpose of helping
                you find the nearest temple or hotel location or for a similar reason. You can edit the settings on your
                device to opt out of location-based services.</p>

            <h3> 3. For what purposes do we process personal data?</h3>

            <p> We use personal data to provide ecclesiastical and other related services to fulfill the mission of the
                Hotel. In this context, the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is either the necessity
                to perform contractual and other obligations that we have towards you or carrying out of our legitimate
                activities as a hotel.</p>

            <p> We may also use your data to comply with applicable laws and exercise legal rights as the basis for our
                data processing.</p>

            <p> We may also use your personal data for internal purposes, including auditing, data analysis, system
                troubleshooting, and research. </p>

            <h3> 4. How long do we retain personal data?</h3>

            <p>We retain collected personal data, including information collected via mobile applications and other
                submissions, for a reasonable period of time to fulfill the processing purposes mentioned above. We then
                archive it for time periods required or necessitated by law or legal considerations. When archiving is
                no longer required, we delete personal data from our records.</p>

            <h3> 5. How can you access and correct your personal data?</h3>

            <p> 

                We endeavor to maintain the accuracy of personal data and rely on you to ensure your personal data is
                complete and accurate. You may request access to your personal data and verify, correct, or rectify
                (including update) it, and block your personal data through your website-specific registration, through
                your profile.</p>

            <p> You may contact us to exercise additional statutory rights such as data portability, objection in
                accordance with applicable laws, restriction of processing, and erasure of your personal data. You also
                have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</p>
